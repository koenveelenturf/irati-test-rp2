# irati-test-rp2
Configuration files for my Research Project 2 @ OS3

In the root of the repository the topology can be found for this experiment. For this experiment the pristine-1.5 stack is used with 'd73d5a7' as latest commit. This commit includes the patch by Eduard Grassa for registering multiple DIFs to the rina-echo-time server. Every folder contains the configuration files needed to run the IRATI stack per node. The files need to be placed in '/etc/'.
